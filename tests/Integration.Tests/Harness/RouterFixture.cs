//   - RouterFixture: fresh router per test, for fixtures that mutate slot state.
//   - SharedRouterFixture: one router for the whole fixture, for read-only or
//     idempotent suites where the spawn cost matters.
// NUnit runs base [SetUp]/[OneTimeSetUp] before derived ones, so derived classes
// can add their own setup methods without overriding anything here.
