### Configuration

RhinoMCP has one command, aptly named `RhinoMCP` which will start the server and let you change the port it is using.

# What can an MCP Server do?

MCP Servers are a new way of controlling your programs. They let you control Rhino but using written human language. You can ask about the model, have your AI agent create things in the model, or organise it for you. The capabilities are endless.
