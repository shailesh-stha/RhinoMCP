![Voxelizer GH1 component and its GH2 equivalent solving side by side](/developer/voxelizer-gh2-conversion.png)

Rhino 9 ships Grasshopper 2 alongside Grasshopper 1. If you have a GH1 plugin and you want to try upgrading to GH2, this is a perfect use of an AI agent and the Rhino MCP server. The MCP exposes parallel `g1_*` and `g2_*` tool families, so the assistant can place a GH1 component and its
new GH2 counterpart on their respective canvases in the same session and compare what they solve to.

We'll use [Voxelizer](https://github.com/ytakzk/Voxelizer) as the running example: a small, single-component GH1 plugin that's easy to follow end to end.

## The loop

With both canvases reachable, the assistant can:

- Read each GH1 component's inputs, outputs, and solve logic.
- Scaffold a GH2 equivalent in a new folder, leaving the GH1 sources
  untouched.
- Place the GH1 component on a GH1 canvas with sample inputs, place the
  new GH2 component on a GH2 canvas with the same inputs, and compare
  outputs through the MCP.
- Iterate until both solve the same way, then move to the next component.

The side-by-side check matters: GH2's parameter and data-tree conventions
aren't a one-for-one match with GH1, so "it compiles and places" isn't
enough on its own.

## A prompt to start with

{{< prompt >}}
Add a GH2 port of this plugin in a folder called `gh2/` in this repo. The GH1
project must build untouched.

Use McNeel's official template, not hand-rolled scaffolding:
  dotnet new install Rhino.Templates
  dotnet new gh2 --IncludeSample false -n <PluginName>Gh2 -o <plugin-name>.gh2

Reference docs while porting:

  Template: https://github.com/mcneel/RhinoVisualStudioExtensions/tree/main/Rhino.Templates/content/CSGrasshopper2

Discover, don't assume:
  - Find the GH1 csproj and list every GH_Component subclass — these
    are what you port.
  - Identify any helper classes that only depend on RhinoCommon (no
    `Grasshopper.Kernel.*`). These should be SHARED, not copied:
      <Compile Include="..\<gh1-folder>\<file>.cs" Link="Shared\..." />
    If there are no such helpers, skip this step.
  - Note each component's inputs and outputs (types, access mode) —
    you'll need this for both the port and the comparison.

Port one component at a time. For each:
  1. Generate or write the GH2 component shell (Component subclass,
     [IoId], Nomen, AddInputs/AddOutputs/Process). Preserve the
     original GH1 ComponentGuid by reusing it as the [IoId] value —
     this keeps any existing GH1 documents that reference it
     identifiable for future upgrade tooling.
  2. Build (.rhp output).
  3. Validate via rhino-mcp:
       - spawn one Rhino WIP
       - place the GH1 component on the GH1 canvas
       - place the GH2 component on the GH2 canvas
       - feed both the same fixture: minimal, deterministic, picked
         based on the component's input types (e.g. a slider for
         numbers, `Mesh Without Normals` for meshes, native geometry
         components for curves/surfaces). If a fixture cannot be
         expressed natively, commit it as a .3dm under
         tests/fixtures/ and load via the MCP.
       - solve both, then compare outputs by type:
           lists/trees: structure (branch + leaf counts) must match
                        exactly
           numeric:     within abs tolerance (default 1e-9) or rel
                        tolerance the agent justifies inline
           geometry:    bbox + element count must match exactly;
                        per-element drift within tolerance is warn,
                        not fail
           bools/ints:  exact equality
       - Mismatch in structure or count = hard fail. Per-element
         drift within tolerance = warn-only.

### Constraints:
  - Don't modify any file under the GH1 source folder.
  - If anything is unclear before you start, ask. Don't infer.
{{< /prompt >}}

## What to review

- **Parameter types.** GH2's type system isn't identical to GH1's; check
  that the assistant picked the right GH2 type rather than the
  closest-named one.
- **Data-tree handling.** If your GH1 component does anything non-trivial
  with branches or paths, look at how that translates. This is the
  most common place for "solves but wrong" bugs.
- **Component metadata.** Names, categories, icons, GUIDs: easy to
  get wrong, hard to fix later once users have files referencing them.

## When the assistant gets stuck

If a component doesn't have a clean GH2 equivalent (or relies on a GH1
API that's gone), have the assistant skip it and surface the list of
skipped components at the end, rather than trying to fake it. A short
"these need human eyes" list is more useful than a stubbed component that
silently solves to nothing.
