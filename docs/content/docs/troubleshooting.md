Common issues. If you don't find your problem here, [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/mcneel/RhinoMCP/issues) or ask in the [Rhino Discourse AI category](https://discourse.mcneel.com/c/rhino/artificial-intelligence-rhino/162).

## My AI Agent doesn't see Rhino at all

Most often this means the connection wasn't made on startup.

1. Restart **quit and reopen** your AI assistant
2. Make sure you installed the Rhino plugin via Rhino's `PackageManager` (search for **Rhino-MCP-Platform**).
3. In Claude Desktop, check Settings &rarr; Extensions to see if the Rhino3d connector is listed as connected.

## Rhino just crashed mid-conversation

The connector notices when Rhino crashes and tells your assistant, so the assistant can offer to relaunch and retry.

If the same prompt keeps causing a crash, ask Claude or your LLM of choice to help you file an issue on GitHub.

## The assistant says it did something, but I don't see it

A few things to check:

- **Are you looking at the right Rhino window?** If you have several open, the assistant may have edited a different one. Look at the window titles.
- **Use View &rarr; Zoom &rarr; Zoom Extents.** the geometry may be far from the origin.
- **Check the layers panel.** Geometry may be on a hidden layer.

## I want to use Rhino 9 (WIP) instead of Rhino 8

The router defaults to Rhino 8. To target Rhino 9:

- **Claude Desktop:** Open the settings for the connector and change 8 to 9
- **Claude Code / custom config:** Add `-v 9` to the `rhino-mcp-router` arguments in your MCP config.

## Grasshopper tools aren't working

- Grasshopper 2 tools (`gh2_`) require **Rhino 9 WIP**.
- If you want to use Grasshopper 2, specify Rhino WIP to your AI Agent

## The MCP Plugin doesn't load or show up in the package manager?

- Net framework is not supported
- Intel Macs are not supported
- Update your Rhino to the latest release

## Anywhere else to ask?
