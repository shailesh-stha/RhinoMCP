If your Rhino plugin's UI is built on WPF, it only runs on Windows. Porting
it to [Eto.Forms](https://github.com/picoe/Eto), the cross-platform
UI toolkit Rhino itself uses, lets the same plugin run on Rhino for
Mac as well. The mechanical parts of that port (rewriting XAML as Eto
layouts, swapping bindings, re-wiring event handlers) are a great fit for
Claude Code with Rhino MCP, because the assistant can build the plugin,
load it into Rhino, and actually open each dialog to see whether it
renders.

## What you need

- **Claude Code** with the [Rhino MCP plugin](../docs/cc-plugin) installed.
- **Rhino** open with Rhino MCP running. If you can run it on both Windows
  and Mac, even better. The whole point of the port is the Mac side.
- Your plugin's source checked out locally, with Claude Code started in
  that repo.

## The loop

With Rhino MCP loaded, the assistant can:

- Read your existing `.xaml` and code-behind files and map controls to
  their Eto equivalents.
- Scaffold an Eto `Dialog` or `Panel` per WPF window, rebuild, and load
  the `.rhp` into Rhino.
- Run the command that opens each dialog and confirm it actually appears,
  rather than just compiles.
- Iterate on layout and bindings one panel at a time.

Opening the dialog after each change is what makes this worth doing
through the MCP. Eto's layout model isn't WPF's, and "it builds"
tells you very little about whether the result is usable.

## A prompt to start with

{{< prompt >}}
This plugin's UI is WPF and only runs on Windows. Port each WPF window to
an Eto.Forms equivalent so the plugin works on Rhino for Mac as well.
Work one window at a time: convert it, build, load the plugin into the
Rhino I have open, run the command that shows the dialog, and confirm it
renders before moving on. Show me the diff before each file change.
{{< /prompt >}}

If you have a mix of dialogs and dockable panels, tell the assistant
which is which. Eto's `Dialog` and Rhino's panel hosting are
different code paths.

## What to review

- **Layout translation.** WPF's `Grid` with star-sizing, `StackPanel`, and
  `DockPanel` don't map one-for-one to Eto's `TableLayout`, `StackLayout`,
  and `DynamicLayout`. Open each ported dialog and check spacing,
  alignment, and what happens when you resize.
- **Data binding.** WPF's `{Binding}` and `INotifyPropertyChanged` flow
  doesn't exist in Eto the same way. The assistant will often replace
  bindings with explicit event wiring. Confirm two-way fields
  still round-trip.
- **Styles and resources.** WPF `Style`, `ResourceDictionary`, and
  control templates have no direct Eto equivalent. Expect these to
  collapse into per-control property setters; spot-check the visual
  result.
- **Platform-specific code-behind.** Anything reaching into
  `System.Windows.*` (clipboard, dispatcher, message boxes) needs an Eto
  or RhinoCommon replacement, not a `#if WINDOWS` wrapper.
- **Rhino panel registration.** If a window is hosted as a Rhino panel,
  the registration attributes and panel GUIDs need to come across too,
  not just the UI class.

## When the assistant gets stuck

If a control has no clean Eto equivalent (custom-drawn WPF controls,
heavy `ItemsControl` templating, third-party WPF libraries), have the
assistant stop and surface the list rather than faking it with a
`Label` that says "TODO". A short "these need a human" list is more
useful than a dialog that opens but does nothing.

For visual diffs, ask the assistant to open the same dialog before and
after on the same Rhino session so you can eyeball the difference.
The MCP can drive that, but it can't tell you whether the new
layout *looks* right.
