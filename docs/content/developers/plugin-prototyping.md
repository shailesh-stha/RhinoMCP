If you've ever wanted to try a plugin idea but couldn't be bothered to
scaffold the project, write the manifest, wire up a command, build,
load, debug, repeat: this is what Rhino MCP plus an AI assistant
removes. Describe what you want the plugin to do, and the assistant can
scaffold it, build it, load it into a running Rhino, exercise its
commands, and iterate on what it sees.

This is closer to "rapid prototyping a plugin idea" than "ship a
production plugin." The output is a starting point you can keep
developing, or throw away once you've decided whether the idea
was worth pursuing.

## What you need

- **Claude Code** with the [Rhino MCP plugin](../docs/cc-plugin)
  installed.
- **Rhino** open with Rhino MCP running, on the Rhino version you want
  to target.
- An empty folder where the assistant can scaffold the plugin, with
  Claude Code started there.
- The Rhino plugin templates installed (`dotnet new install
  Rhino.Templates`), or willingness to let the assistant install
  them.

## A prompt to start with

{{< prompt >}}
Scaffold a Rhino 8 plugin in this folder called `EdgeAudit`. It
should add one command, `EdgeAuditReport`, that scans the active doc
for Breps with naked edges, prints a per-object count to the command
line, and selects the worst offender. Use the standard plugin
template, target `net7.0`, and once it builds load it into Rhino and
run the command on whatever's open so I can see it work.
{{< /prompt >}}

Adjust scope to taste: one command, three commands, a Grasshopper
component, a display conduit. The pattern is the same.

## What you should see

The assistant runs `dotnet new rhinoplugin` (or equivalent), edits the
generated command file to match your spec, builds the `.rhp`, loads it
into the running Rhino via `run_command` (`_PluginManager` /
`_-LoadPlugIn`), and then invokes the new command. It reads the command
line output back through the MCP, so it can tell whether the command
actually did what you asked, not just whether it compiled.

If the first build fails or the command misbehaves, expect an iterate
loop: edit, build, reload, re-run, observe. The whole point of doing
this through Rhino MCP is that the assistant closes that loop itself.

## What to review

Even for a throwaway prototype, glance at:

- **The plugin GUID and manifest.** If you might keep the plugin, make
  sure the GUID is the assistant's, not a placeholder from the
  template, and that the plugin name / version are what you want.
- **Where it loads from.** The assistant will usually load the built
  `.rhp` from `bin/Debug/...`. That's fine for prototyping; for
  anything you want to keep, decide whether to ship via Yak or copy to
  the plugins folder.
- **API choices.** Brand-new RhinoCommon code from an assistant is
  often *almost right*: the right namespace, a plausible method
  name, slightly wrong arguments. Read the diff with the
  [RhinoCommon docs](https://developer.rhino3d.com/api/rhinocommon/)
  open in the other window.
- **Cleanup.** Prototyping leaves loaded plugins in your Rhino session.
  If you abandon the experiment, unload it before forgetting.

## When the assistant gets stuck

- **Template missing.** If `dotnet new rhinoplugin` isn't available,
  the assistant should install `Rhino.Templates` rather than
  hand-rolling a `.csproj`. The templates set up a lot of
  boring things correctly.
- **Plugin won't load.** Usually a target-framework mismatch (plugin
  built for `net8.0`, Rhino running `net7.0`) or a missing reference.
  Ask the assistant to print the exact load error from Rhino's command
  line before guessing.
- **"Works on the next reload."** Rhino caches loaded plugin
  assemblies; for tight iteration loops, use the plugin developer's
  reload flow (or just unload, rebuild, reload). The assistant should
  do this for you; if it skips the reload step, builds will land but
  behaviour won't change.

  the prototype proves the idea, you'll want it on a modern target.
